# OralChess
DISCLAIMER: This project is under construction, not a fully working solution. Whenever I find free time, I update it. For the time being it is a side project.

Motivation: This is one of my self-learning projects. I am building it to learn APIs, Android Development and effective use of third-party plugins and modules.

## Specifications

*Oral Chess* is an **android application** which connects to the lichess.org server, using the **Lichess API**. 
The application helps visually impaired players to play chess on the lichess web platform.
It allows them to play by speaking out the moves to the microphone of their phone and listening to their oponents moves through 
their phone's speakers.
